It's very good .
You can modify something.
Reverse string don't use built function.


Find 2nd smallest or largest.
You can check error condition.
If you have only one value in list.. it will come error.

Please give standard function name like.
getSecondSmallestNumber

17/06/2019, 1:28 pm - Rakesh ML: Task 3
1)what is the digit value of the factorial number?
Input :  5   output : 3(5! = 120) 
Input :  6   output : 3(6! = 720)
Input :  7   output : 4(7! = 5040) 
Input :  4   output : 2(4! = 24)
Input :  3   output : 1(3! =6)

2)Replace the current value with the next large value in an array, if there is no any large value exists in an array, so Replace with -1.

Tese Case : 1) Input :  [2,1,5,2,6,2] . output : [5,5,6,6-1,-1]

Tese Case : 2) Input :  [2,1,5,2,6,20] . output : [5,5,6,6-20,-1]

Tese Case : 3) Input :  [22,1,5,2,6,20] . output : [-1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1]

Tese Case : 4) Input :  [0,1,5,2,6,20] . output : [20,20,20,20,20,-1]

Tese Case : 4) Input :  [100,111,115,222,666,777] . output : [111,115,222,666,777,-1]

17/06/2019, 4:01 pm - +91 94810 71831: I didn‚Äôt get the second question. How are we getting two -1 ?
17/06/2019, 4:01 pm - +91 94810 71831: The first 4 elements are clear
17/06/2019, 4:02 pm - +91 94810 71831: Last element is -1 that‚Äôs also clear
17/06/2019, 4:02 pm - +91 94810 71831: I‚Äôm asking about last but 1
17/06/2019, 4:03 pm - +91 99865 94131: Doesn't test logic as much
17/06/2019, 4:04 pm - Rakesh ML: You have to compare present value to next large value, that value should be anywhere next of present value.
If you will not get large value in list, you have to update with-1
17/06/2019, 4:04 pm - Rakesh ML: No
17/06/2019, 4:04 pm - +91 94810 71831: Ok

17/06/2019, 4:06 pm - +91 94810 71831: Two consecutive elements are the same
17/06/2019, 4:06 pm - +91 94810 71831: Something like [5,5,5,5]
17/06/2019, 4:07 pm - Rakesh ML: Read carefully, I have mentioned next large value
17/06/2019, 4:08 pm - Rakesh ML: 5<5 false
5<6
True
17/06/2019, 4:08 pm - Rakesh ML: Comparison between large value only

17/06/2019, 9:18 pm - +91 86046 49926: Second question is still not clear, if we have to find the next large value of current value then in example 4 the output should be [1, 2,6,6,20,-1]
17/06/2019, 9:21 pm - +91 96035 94976: No, next large value in the sense, value in the immediate index
17/06/2019, 9:22 pm - +91 99865 94131: Immediate larger number
17/06/2019, 9:22 pm - +91 96035 94976: If value in the immediate index is less then present value then go for next index value
17/06/2019, 9:23 pm - +91 86046 49926: Okay thanks
17/06/2019, 9:33 pm - +91 86046 49926: @918951101651 i have pushed both the codes plz review

20/06/2019, 7:52 am - +91 94818 87872: Hi all, i came across question..where they had given a sum such that target variable  x and degree of a number n is given ..we need to express number num in fashion of num**n=x or num1**n+num2**n=x or num1**n+num2**n+num3**n=x and so on in python...can anybody share inputs on logic
21/06/2019, 9:22 am - Rakesh ML: Interview Technical questions are very common nowadays.

Expression oriented functions of Python provides are:

1. map(aFunction, aSequence)
2. filter(aFunction, aSequence)
3. reduce(aFunction, aSequence)
4. lambda
5. list comprehension


Interview very important coding question
